Clisent Server Messenger in Java

Send files from client to Server

In the first task you are asked to implement an application in which a user can store their file contents on a remote server. The application will be based on the client-server model by using Socket to communicate between the two entities. This means that the client will have to send a connection request to the server following the TCP protocol, and when they log in, the client will be able to send file data. The application of the server should not support threads, so at any given time only one customer can be served.
